              By Philip Roth 
            “My dad gave me the novel Letting Go by Philip Roth. 
            Dad read very little fiction—only one book of fiction a year.
             He was a political scientist, and he read dozens and dozens of non-fiction, 
             academic books every year. But he always became enthusiastic about his one, annual book of fiction,
              which he would then recommend to everyone.

              Bsy Erica Jong
              “Knowing it is my favorite book, for my 34th birthday,
              a boyfriend once gave me a signed first edition of Erica Jong’s Fear of Flying. 
              Having always read tattered paperback versions, I had no idea the original was adorned with a spectacularly 
              ornate cover that’s evocative of a Hieronymus Bosch.  I’m not a big collector of anything but no matter how 
              often I pare down my belongings, I never get rid of this.  (Even though the boyfriend was long-ago lost to history, his accompanying birthday card remains tucked inside the book.)” —Lisa Napoli, author of Ray & Joan
